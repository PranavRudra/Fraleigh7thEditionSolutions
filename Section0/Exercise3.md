# Exercise #3

The prime factorization of $60$ is $2^2 \times 3 \times 5$. Hence, the set of integer divisors of $60$ is:

$\\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60\\}$

This makes sense because the cardinality of this set is $12$ and $(2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1)$ (i.e. the number of ways to build a factor of $60$) is also $12$.
